        "## Tabular vs. Non-Tabular Models\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous notebook, we used a tabular machine learning model for forecasting. Tabular models, such as [decision forests](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/decision-forests), [feed-forward neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network), [SVMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine), and [Nearest neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) work well when each column of the dataset represents an independent piece of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, not all datasets are tabular. In non-tabular data, the key patterns or discriminative information lie in the relationships between features, not just their individual values. Consider an [image classification task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision#Recognition) where the objective is to detect cats: treating each pixel as an independent column in a tabular model ignores the spatial relationships that define a cat's shape. The model might learn to recognize cats in one specific location, but struggle to generalize that knowledge to other parts of the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple neural networks, like feed-forward networks, suffer from the problem described above. However, neural networks have a peculiarity: their architecture is flexible. This flexibility allows us to design architectures to consume special types of non-tabular data such as images, graphs, text... and time series. You might have heard of architecture names such as [convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNNs), [recurrent neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) (RNNs), [graph neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network) (GNN), or [transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)).\n",

        "## Neural Networks for Time Series\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use specialized neural networks for time series forecasting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the noteworthy models in this category include **DeepAR**, **NHits** and **PatchTST** - which use a recurrent, MLP, and transformer-based architecture respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "There's a problem with these though - they need to be trained. And training a huge transformer network, like PatchTST, is costly, slow and requires a lot of data. This is why a new class of models started emerging last year: **foundational** time series models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of foundational models as the equivalent of big pretrained LLMs (since they pretty much are) - they are pretrained on enormous amounts of data, and can be applied zero-shot (i.e., without re-training) on unseen time series. Some noteworthy models in this area include Nixtla's TimeGPT, Google's TimesFM, and AWS' Chronos.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that this is very much an active area of research - and we are presenting them as an interesting development rather than as a recommended approach for a production system :)\n",
        "\n",
        "Designing neural network architectures can be complex, so we'll focus on two libraries that provide pre-configured models, making them easier to use:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **DeepAR**: This model uses an autoregressive recurrent neural network architecture. We will train this model and then generate predictions. See the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110) for more details.\n",
